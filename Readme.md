 I have learned lot of things during this project like how to configure vite server and how to deploy vite without error.while deployment I have lot of errors and css didn't work!.To fix this issue my collegues suggest me to configure using **npm run build** after complete the devlopment process. when using **npm run build** method in terminal it will configure minified version of our project folder called **dist** . In that dist folder have minified version of css. Then I link that css file into my index.html file(not minified version). and comment the main.css linking and push the entire code to github.Then it will worksðŸ˜‡.
